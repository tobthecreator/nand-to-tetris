The course recommends that you do this in two sections.

Build up to RAM64 yourself, then using built-in RAM64 and the like as you build up to RAM16k.

I've put the RAM64 files and the like in the "low-level" folder, and the larger chips in the "high-level" folder

Low level:
DFF (given)
Bit
Register
RAM8
RAM64

High level:
RAM512
RAM4K
RAM16K
PC
